This repository demonstrates the ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) synthesis of an audio sine wave signal. 
ADSR is a widely used envelope model that shapes the amplitude of a sound over time. 
This approach is typically used in synthesizers to control how a sound evolves from the moment a note is played to when it fades out.


What is ADSR?
ADSR stands for the four stages of the envelope.

Attack (A). The time it takes for the sound to go from silence to its maximum amplitude after the note is triggered.

Decay (D). The time it takes for the sound to decrease from its maximum amplitude to the sustain level.

Sustain (S). The amplitude level that the sound maintains while the note is held.

Release (R) The time it takes for the sound to fade from the sustain level to silence after the note is released.

In the context of synthesizing an audio sine wave, the ADSR envelope is applied to control the amplitude of the sine wave over time.
