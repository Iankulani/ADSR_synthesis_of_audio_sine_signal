# ADSR_synthesis_of_audio_sine_signal
This repository demonstrates the ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) synthesis of an audio sine wave signal. ADSR is a widely used envelope model that shapes the amplitude of a sound over time. This approach is typically used in synthesizers to control how a sound evolves from the moment a note is played to when it fades out.
